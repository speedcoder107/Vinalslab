So, the ising_monte_carlo is creating a prelimilary simulation of what I want

The, the import numpy as np create an html simulation with a lot of pngs in the animation frames

Then, the import cv2 creates a mp4 file. 

To rum import cv2 on your computer, use the following instruction. Other than the normal package installation, you would also need to install 'ffmpeg' 
To do that, first install chocolatey
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
Right-click on the Start button and select "Command Prompt (Admin)" or "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".

Run the Installation Command:
Copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt and press Enter:

@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

Wait for Installation:
The installation process may take a few moments to complete. Once done, Chocolatey should be installed on your system.

Verify Installation:
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Chocolatey is installed correctly by running:

choco -?



Once, this is done, open vs code again. This time in Administrator mode. 
Open a New Terminal Window:

Either press Ctrl + Shift + ``, or go to the menu and select Terminal>New Terminal`.
This will open a new terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code interface.
Select Command Prompt or PowerShell:

By default, Visual Studio Code opens the terminal with PowerShell. Change it to use Command Prompt only for this step:
Click on the dropdown arrow at the top-right corner of the terminal window.
Select "Command Prompt" from the dropdown menu, depending on your preference.
Verify Chocolatey Installation:

Once the terminal is open, you can verify that Chocolatey is installed by running:

choco -?

If Chocolatey is installed correctly, you'll see the Chocolatey help message displayed in the terminal.

then run the following command

choco install ffmpeg
(if it shows, some error about file not being accessable then, make sure that vs code is open in Administrator mode)
(if it shows some error about it already being there, but no instlled package, then force a re-install by using the following command:

choco install ffmpeg --force

)

Once it has successfully installed, close that terminal and open a python terminal and run the following Command:

pip install imageio[ffmpeg]   

once you are done with all this, then, you can rum the import cv2 code to get a video out of it.






Now, let's talk Cython. First of all, pip install cython. 

run setup.py

 

to use cython, run setup.py, using this:  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
If it throws error that, it can't delete a file, becasue of "access denied" usually happens when you are re-running the program. Then, you need to manually delete a .pxd file.

Also, it needs,  Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required". So, for that, you can use two things, 

1. install visual studio Build tools using this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261546/how-to-solve-error-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-or-greater-is-required-when-inst

2. or run the following code in the terminal
Upgrade your pip with: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Upgrade your wheel with: pip install --upgrade wheel
Upgrade your setuptools with: pip install --upgrade setuptools
Close the terminal
Try running the setup.py again
